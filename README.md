Automated Report Generation with Python
This project demonstrates an automated report generation system using Python. The script reads data from a CSV file, analyzes it using the pandas library, and generates a well-formatted PDF report using the FPDF library.

Project Overview
The automated report generation process is designed to simplify data analysis and reporting. It allows users to upload a structured data file (like a CSV), processes the data to calculate key metrics, and outputs a PDF report with the findings. This project can be customized for various datasets, making it a powerful tool for reporting in multiple domains.

Features
Data Input: Reads data from a CSV file for analysis.

PDF Generation: Produces a well-structured and easy-to-read PDF report.
Customizable: The script is modular, making it easy to expand for additional functionality like data visualization.
